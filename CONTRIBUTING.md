# Contributing to the Generator

There is a list of things that I'm yet to implement in the [Projects tab](https://github.com/ryceg/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator/projects). 

## JavaScript Style Guide
So, a lot of the stuff doesn't follow the style guide, but I'm gradually changing it all over (an automatic formatter & linter is a magical thing!). For all *future* content, please follow [the Standard style guide](https://github.com/standard/standard) on how to notate JavaScript. Single quotes please.

### Updating non-compliant style stuff
Please do! But, make sure that you've caught everything- some of the earlier variables don't follow $fooBarBah style capitalising of new words, and all sorts of variables are littered throughout the whole thing, so please make sure that you're not "fixing" one bit, and then breaking it in four other places.

## Submitting direct content additions (i.e. just simply adding stuff to an array)
This is really easy, and a great way to get started contributing! Please ensure that you have included the appropriate double quote marks and commas. 

Bad: `<<set $bim to ["foo", "bar", "bah",]>>`

Bad: `<<set $bim to ["foo" "bar" "bah"]>>`

Good: `<<set $bim to ["foo", "bar", "bah"]>>`

Also okay: `<<set $bim to ['foo', 'bar', 'bah']>>`

### Adding new functions and content
Please do!
