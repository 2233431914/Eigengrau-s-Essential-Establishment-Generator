<<set _chemist to $alchemist.chemist>>_chemist.firstName looks _chemist.currentMood.random(), and idly shifts a box of <<print either(_chemist.ingredients)>> as _chemist.heshe talks. The _chemist.raceNote <<print _chemist.chitchat.random()>> as you peruse the shop. _chemist.firstName tells you that _chemist.heshe is working on a $brew.potionPurpose, and points to the <<linkappend $brew.containerDescription>>. Looking inside the $brew.vesselType, you see a $brew.liquidDescription bubbling away<</linkappend>>.
