	name: "Gnollblood",
	type: "non-magical mead",
	cost: 30,
	description: "While the inventor of this recipe is said to have been human, anyone is welcome to make it- if they can survive the trial of getting the ingredients. True to its name, after the mead is sweetened with honey and boiled with a blend of spices, the maker stirs in just enough gnoll's blood to give the brew a salty, rusty undertone. This conveys no magical benefit, but it's still quite popular among the wealthy citizens of the local cities. Brewers within the city limits will pay handsomely for fresh gnoll carcasses to keep their blood supply in check.",

	name: "Bragget",
	type: "goblin 'wine'",
	cost: 34,
	description: "Made from fermented, often rotting cave mushrooms, bragget is the favored drink of any goblin who wants to quickly lose their inhibition. There's no real recipe to follow- simply throw a handful of fresh mushrooms into a vat of water, forget it for several months, rediscover the vat after a crew of adventurers break into your cave system, and drink it. Effects range from a gleeful, giddy state of inebriation to death from dysentery. Or both.",

	{
	name: "Cobbler's cream",
	type: "rotgut",
	cost: 26,
	description: "Gnomes who dwell along the forest's edge often send their young to forage for meals in dense, semi-cultivated plots filled with berries, brambles, succulent flowers and herbs of all varieties. Having not yet developed a callous thick enough to endure the thorns, prickles and stings, many young Gnomes often wear carved wooden shoes and heavy leather gaiters to protect themselves. When a young Gnome reaches maturity, however, they are expected to retire their shoes back to the cobbler, where the toes are stuffed full of harvested berries, leaves, mushrooms and whatever else comes to hand. The shoes are then hung from the rafters over a large vat, where steam, time, and the natural yeasts in the porous wood allow droplets of alcoholic liquid to seep through the shoe, and fall into the roiling mixture below. Mixed with rainwater, and served in usually cleaned wooden shoes, the resulting beverage is incredibly potent, with a flavor profile that ranges from incredibly profane to lavender, with notes of sweet sap. Gnomes who consume it often do so in celebratory contexts, and in small quantities. Most others experience temporary blindness and an intense hatred for Gnomes.",

	{
	name: "Blood clot",
	type: "Dwarven sludge",
	cost: 42,
	description: "This bizarre concoction is a favorite among Dwarves looking to make a dare. Thick and red, it contains a congealed glob of fermented goat milk about the size of a golf ball. An acquired taste, it is reminiscent of fortified wine with a strong hint of copper.",

	{
	name: "Axegrinder Ale",
	type: "Dwarvish ale",
	cost: 34,
	description: "In the right light, this ale takes on a blood red hue. It gives off a strong scent like a floral meadow covered in dew and tastes slightly sour on the way down with a sweaty finish. Dwarves who consume it often become mildly belligerent and take offense the smallest slights. Most others who consume it experience a noticeable uptick in their spirits. Except trolls, who just get angry.",

	{
	name: "Bitterbeard Ale",
	type: "Dwarvish ale",
	cost: 36,
	description: "This translucent gold ale is topped with a clean white foam and tastes a little pungent and bitter with hints of citrus. Dwarves who consume it tend to brood over hated foes, especially 'the one that got away.' Non-dwarves who consume it typically experience a pleasant evening followed by a poor night's sleep.",

	{
	name: "Meadowlark",
	type: "Human wheat beer",
	cost: 30,
	description: "In a world full of 750,000-proof Elven cordials and Dwarven stouts so thick you'd think they were bottled mud, sometimes you just need a good beer. Mild, refreshing, and flavorful, Meadowlark is a beer by humans, for humans, which means that just about every halfling from here to the Drypeak Mountains is drinking it. The noble think it crude, the elves think it unimaginative, the dwarves find it cowardly, but the farmers who drop themselves down at a tavern table at the end of the day wouldn't have anything else.",

	{
	name: "Frostbomb",
	type: "Pale ale",
	cost: 66,
	description: "The life's work of a dragonborn brewmaster. Frostbomb is somewhat disconcerting, for a couple of reasons. One, it's blue. For those who prefer not to consume things that are the color of their cousin Clyde that one time he tried to swallow a carrot whole, that might be a bit of a turn-off. Two, it is absolutely frigid. The steel bottles that it's shipped in are often coated in a thick rime of frost that must be hacked off before serving, and the cold magic in the brew must be allowed to sit for at least four minutes before it's warm enough to not be painful going down. All that being said, there isn't a traveler alive who doesn't hope to stumble upon a bottle under the counter in a desert bar.",

	{
	name: "Steve's Mead",
	type: "Mead",
	cost: 35,
	description: "This bottle of mead might have had a label, once, but it appears to have been torn off. In its place, painted directly on the bottle, are the words 'STEVE'S MEAD' in blocky, crude letters. Clearly, Steve is not around to claim his mead, but in his absence the cork appears to be permanently and irrevocably stuck in the mouth of the bottle.",

	{
	name: "Self-important Prick",
	type: "Brown ale",
	cost: 36,
	description: "The ale inside this bottle isn't terribly unusual, aside from being harsh and bitter. The true draw is the printing on the bottle, which reads 'Self-Important Prick' in white letters. Under the lettering is a rendition of a face--a rendition that changes to reflect whoever the drinker dislikes the most at that particular time. There are allegations that drinking the ale results in heightened animosity toward the depicted person, but it might just be a result of reminding them that that person exists in the first place.",

	{
	name: "Deep Grog",
	type: "Blackest Tot",
	cost: 44,
	description: "The darkest of naval rum taken from sunken sips mixed with saltwater taken from the pelagic depths of the Elemental Plane of Water. Black and cold, with a syrupy mouth feel. Tastes of brine and molasses with a distinct bitterness. Reserved for first time travelers to The City of Glass, and served as a shot with a still beating fish heart. Also disparagingly known as Aboleth's Piss.",

	{
	name: "Old Polder Genever Gin",
	type: "Spirit's Spirits",
	cost: 49,
	description: "The recipe for this liquor was pulled from the ruins of the necropolis of Polder. Clear or just faintly brown, sweet with juniper and malt. More like a whiskey than a gin. Purportedly aged in oak barrels with a single golden coin taken from the dead city, luck be damned. Said to be able to distract hungry dead by offering shots. Popular gift on Spirt's Eve.",

	{
	name: "Hyperborean Cider",
	type: "Bottled Sunshine",
	cost: 46,
	description: "Fermented with juice made from apples collected from the Celestial Plane. Gloriously, radiantly golden, no head, ever, and never sours. Sweet and warm, with hints of clove, cinnamon, and sunrises. You can still get a hangover, donâ€™t believe that myth, and there are few things in the multiverse worse than being hungover on the Celestial Plane. Everyone is singing and everything IS SO VERY BRIGHT.",

	{
	name: "Airak",
	type: "Djinn and Juice",
	cost: 88,
	description: "Distilled on the Elemental Plane of Air by the Djinn in a process that uses no machinery, but by captive air elementals controlling the temperatures and pressures while the liquid free floats in the air. Clear when poured but will louche when exposed to normal air pressure. Tastes of licorice, anise, and a warm breeze with a slight bitter aftertaste. Makes you lightheaded, maybe literally. Best mixed.",
