$chemist.firstname looks <<print $chemist.currentmood.random()>>, and idly shifts a box of <<print either($chemist.ingredients)>> as $chemist.heshe talks. The $chemist.racenote <<print either($chemist.chitchat)>> as you peruse the shop. $chemist.firstname tells you that $chemist.heshe is working on a $brew.purpose, and points to the $brew.containerDescription which is bubbling away happily. Looking inside the $brew.vessel, you see . When you say that you're adventurers, $chemist.hisher $chemist.eyes eyes light up, and $chemist.heshe says "<<print either($chemist.calltoaction)>>"
