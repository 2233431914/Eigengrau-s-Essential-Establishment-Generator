$chemist.firstname looks $chemist.currentmood, and idly prepares an ingredient which he tells the less alchemically inclined of you is <<print either($chemist.ingredients)>> as $chemist.heshe talks. The $chemist.racenote <<print either($chemist.chitchat)>> as you peruse the shop, and asks you about yourselves. When you say that you're adventurers, $chemist.hisher $chemist.eyes eyes light up, and $chemist.heshe says <<print either($chemist.calltoaction)>>
