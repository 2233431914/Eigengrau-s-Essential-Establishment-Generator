I hunt game in the surrounding areas and sell it to the local merchants. I'm still trying to find a way to cure this Memory Decay of mine and to learn more about why these things are happening to him. To learn more about whoever or whatever the beast of shadows is..

Tylien Birchbottom was kidnapped by a local cult at the age of 14. They keep him secluded for multiple days before tying him to an altar and using his body to perform a ritual to an ancient being known as ‘the beast of shadows’. Half-way through the ritual, the room was infiltrated by guards who had been tracking the cult for weeks, they arrested the cultists and freed Tylien. Obviously, Tylien was pretty traumatised after that, but things eventually seemed to get better until things got a whole lot worse. Tylien began to find himself speaking in otherworldly languages and finding himself experiencing lost time. The strange occurrences grew and grew and Tylien found himself able to use certain abilities, to be able to talk to people through their minds or make people see and hear things that weren't really there. The lost time got a lot worse as well, so much so and Tylien can't remember more than a week into his past. That is why he now keeps a journal on him, one that accounts his life and his past and the things he needs to remember, and he reads it daily.*/
