# Eigengrau's Essential Establishment Generator

### A Tabletop Generator Unlike Any Other

[Eigengrau's Essential Establishment Generator](https://eigengrausgenerator.com/), or EEEG for short, is a tabletop procedural generation tool for towns, npcs, and more. It creates paragraphs of text suitable to be read directly to the players during a game. No longer do you have to simply describe a generic, unnamed tavern as "small"- this is the sort of stuff that you can read out instead;
